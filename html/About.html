				I have been around in the IT world for more than 30 years. My career followed the development of the PC from email, thru BBS's, gophers, ftp, to the internet and SOA's. I have experienced most of the changes in IT, which most people just read about. Every
				job that I ever had, I got was not based on my past experiences, but for the potential I bought with me. Every job required that I learn new technologies, new modeling skills, new design techniques and new testing abilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am very creative, and a very fast learner. I pick up new skills at the drop of a hat. I get bored just doing maintenance. I prefer to be the explorer, creating new paths, to go where no man has gone before. I am constantly going to school to learn the
				new technologies (I have four degrees). I am a beta tester for Microsoft, atalsoft, and several other companies, I love breaking in new software, checking out the limits. I am the first person at infousa to be using Windows Vista Enterprise, as well
				as the Office 2007 suite.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tron Software Limited is a private, not for profit company, used to do research and development in the IT world. It is my company, and I used it to stay current with technology. My latest project is the windows home server. My research has shown me, that
				almost all of the software required for most of the current websites has already been written. Even your web site is based on the current template for online internet stores. Innovation is hard to do, while code reuse is cheap. I am not saying that
				code reuse is bad, in today's world, it is required. The question is how to apply the current crop of code, and then make it better. How do you create something that does not exist, even as an idea?</p>
			<p>
				I am a needle in the haystack, a diamond in the rough, a person that people use for ideas. A couple of ideas I came up with recently was a content manager, based on wikipedia, called infopedia. It allows sales people to browse all the products being sold
				by infousa. The other one was a time tracking program, based on the time tracking starter kit, used to track the time spend fixing maintenance issues.</p>
			<p>
				I am sometimes called the software guru, software wizard and various other names. I am creative, passionate, bright, and talented. I am currently looking for a company that can use my skills, and abilities. I can fill so many different positions within
				a company that many companies do not know what to do with me. I am a problem solver, in that When a problem is encountered I look for a way to fix it, and not who to blame.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am looking for a job, where I can be creative, innovative, be able to use state of the art technologies. I am looking for experience as a Software Architect. I expect the company to provide me with the state of the art workstations and servers. I would
				like to work from home. I have high speed (15MBPS for cox cable) and should be able to connect to the servers via VPN. The workstation should be dual quad cores with max memory, two dual output graphics, four 20 inch LCD displays. The servers include
				web servers, database servers, and file servers at the development level, test level, stage level and production lever.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for software, I prefer to use Microsoft products, but java/unix is acceptable. As long as I have all the tools, applications and programs to support the environment. Since most companies use both environments, I will need access to both. A universal
				subscription to Microsoft, will keep the software up to date. For instance I am currently using SQL server 2005, Visual studio 2005, with Vista Enterprise.</p>
			<p>
				What you can add to your team? Thirty-five years of experience in just about every aspect of software development, Twenty years of education, Working knowledge of over a dozen programming languages, a half dozen databases and hundreds of tools. My resume
				is so large that I put it on the internet, but I have included a brief resume and a monster.com resume.</p>
